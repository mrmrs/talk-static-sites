Yes it does.

It matters because performance matters in general. You might care about
performance for different reasons, but I can’t think of a single reason you
wouldn’t care at all.

I care about performance because I think a users time is the most valuable
thing and shouldn’t be wasted for any reason. You might care about
performance because you want to make more money.

I just think you should care.
