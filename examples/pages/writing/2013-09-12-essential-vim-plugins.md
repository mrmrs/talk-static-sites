As a front-end developer I've found these plugins to be quite wonderful for editing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While
I'm comfortable running stock vim, I prefer to have these plugins installed as a part of my setup.

I do not have a strong preference between pathogen and vundle for package management.
I have used both - but am currently using
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim 'Vundle - vim package manager')

# The List

[Ag](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim 'Ag.vim - Plugin for the silver searcher') <br>
My most invaluable plugin. Speeds up my ability to search for strings in both code and filenames then
step through results from my query.

[Gundo](https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim/ 'Gundo - Visualize your history')<br>
Vim indexes your text-editing history in extremely powerful ways.
But a tree of changes with many branches can be a tough thing to visualize in your head.
This plugin exposes just how powerful vim's history is.

[Ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/ 'ctrlp - fuzzy finder')<br>
Fuzzy find files quickly and easily

[Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive 'Fugitive - a Git wrapper for Vim')<br>
Fugitive is a wrapper for git commands. It allows you to have a more efficient git workflow
without ever leaving the comforts of vim.

[Snipmate-plus](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate 'Snippets for Vim')<br>
Save custom snippets on a per file-type basis. Modeled after snippets in textmate.

[Html5.vim](https://github.com/othree/html5.vim 'Syntax highlighting for html5')<br>
Syntax highlighting for new HTML5 elements.

[Scss-syntax.vim](https://github.com/cakebaker/scss-syntax.vim)<br>
Syntax highlighting for sass.

[Vim-css3-syntax](https://github.com/hail2u/vim-css3-syntax)<br>
Syntax highlighting for css3

[Vim-javascript-syntax](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax)<br>
Syntax highlighting for javascript

## Extras

I don't currently use these plugins but have found them useful at times.
Note that syntastic can choke a bit if you are editing extremely large files.

[Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic 'Syntastic')<br>
[Lint](https://github.com/joestelmach/lint.vim 'Lint')<br>
[Sparkup](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup 'Sparkup')<br>
[Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround 'Surround')<br>
