I don't believe there is a magical silver-bullet list of books to read that
will make you a great designer. There are a lot of books about how to get
better at design. It becomes almost daunting. In my quest to become a
better designer I have read a lot of books that were not very helpful. The
following is a list of books that I have found to be invaluable. They are
the books that I read over and over again. And while you shouldn't feel
limited to what is on this list, if these are the only books you read... I
think you'll be okay.
