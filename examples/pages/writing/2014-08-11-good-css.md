Since I've started authoring css, I've been asking myself and other css
developers the same question: <b>What is 'good css?'</b> After many years of
writing, refactoring, and deleting css; this is a short list of things I
believe to be true.

### Good CSS...

- Doesn't break <b>any</b> functionality of plain html.
- Makes an interface more readable for <b>everyone</b> on any device.
- Enhances the usability and accessibility of an interface on all devices for all users.
- Allows you to quickly change a single interface without breaking other interfaces.
- Renders quickly in the browser.
- Runs at 60fps (no jank on window resize or during scrolling).

### Good CSS is...

- Highly reusable - even across projects
- Well documented
- Easy to read and understand
- ID free
- Mobile-first
- Easy to maintain
- As small as possible
