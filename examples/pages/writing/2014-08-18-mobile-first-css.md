What is mobile-first CSS?

Mobile-first CSS has pretty much nothing to do with mobile-first design or
development practices. They can be related, but don't have to be.

Mobile-first CSS has to do with how you architect your code and media queries,
as well as how browsers parse your CSS.

I often times step into codebases that have max-width media queries that target
mobile devices. Something to the tune of:

```
.post-title {
  font-size: 48px;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {
  .post-title {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

When I first started using media queries - this was a constant pattern in my
code. I was used to writing desktop styles first and I loved the convenience of
being able to 'fix' my desktop design for mobile.

Something didn't feel right though. And I started to wonder.
Is this pattern really an anti-pattern?

In Harry Roberts' wonderfully written ['code smells in css'](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/)
there is a great line that helped shape the way I think about authoring CSS:

> Rulesets should only ever inherit and add to previous ones, never undo.
[ - Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css)

When applying this thinking to how we architect our media queries, we could say
a device shouldn't parse multiple definitions of the same ruleset if it doesn't
have to.

When a devices web browser parses your CSS, it doesn't parse the code within
media queries that don't apply to it.

I.E devices that have a screen-width smaller than 64em will not parse anything
inside this block:

```
@media only screen and (min-width: 64em) {
   /* Some CSS here */
}
```

In other words **all CSS that isn't inside a media query will get parsed by
your mobile-devices no-matter what**. So you should use that to target the
smallest devices with your default styles and override from there as your
content demands it.

Anecdotally since I started developing my CSS mobile-first, I build fully
responsive interfaces much more quickly as opposed to when I start at large
screen-sizes and work backwards from there. I find that I don't have to 'fix'
my desktop view as my mobile-first CSS works as a desktop interface. I do
override my mobile styles to enhance a design at larger screensizes...but I
never feel like I'm fixing broken things. This was a big shift in my mental
approach for authoring CSS.

Another by-product of making the switch to mobile-first CSS, was lighter-weight
CSS files. Personally I think smaller files are rad because there is less to
read and the less you have to read the more time you have to look at cat gifs.
