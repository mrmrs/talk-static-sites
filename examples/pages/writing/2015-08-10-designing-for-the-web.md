A brief look at my design process when building things for the web.

*  Try to identify the problem that needs to be solved
*  Do research
*  Create some content
*  Edit content
*  Sketch ideas
*  Write some words
*  Edit words
*  Sketch some more
*  Build a prototype
*  Make it fast
*  Make it readable
*  Make it work for everyone in every context
*  Test it with users
*  Ship it
*  Test it with users
*  Go back to step #1
