HTML is by default: responsive, vector, and highly readable on any device.
Think about that for a second.

There is an abundance of CSS on the web that constricts these built-in
features of HTML.  I believe that as CSS authors, we have a responsibility to
stop this.  If you find yourself writing CSS that removes any of these three
features, take a minute to stop and rethink its purpose.  Ask yourself what
problem could be so important that it's worth solving at the cost of
universal access to your content &amp; readability?

CSS is not here to make our lives as developers easy. It's here to enhance
the usability of the web for our users. *CSS should never* limit usability.

When we write stylesheets that cascade, we should keep these simple points in
mind.
